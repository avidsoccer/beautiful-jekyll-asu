Now that my kids are adults and raising families of their own, I was finally able to go back to school:

- Advance my knowledge and understanding of data science
- Complete the program on the way to a PHD (maybe)
- Retire from the corporate world and help train and enable future generations

What else do you need?

### My story

Part of my role is compliance and privacy, so this seems a bit invasive...  Unless I am also a fictional character.
